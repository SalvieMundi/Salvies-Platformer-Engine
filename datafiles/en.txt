/* DIALOGUE */
//intro
Everything was under control... 
Then suddenly the day turned to night
and everything changed...

//mushroom forest
Hiya, traveler!
Silent type, eh? 
Well, if you're looking for Mushroom Forest Village, it's up ahead!
Keep an eye out for monsters, though! 
Ever since that new mayor got in, things have been going downhill! 
I sure wish he'd change his ways!

Hey, everyone! It's them!
Who?
That hero with the psychic powers!
I heard they can turn people good again by battling their inner demons!
Codswallop! That's just fairy tales!
DOES IT MATTER??
If they get to the mayor, we're all gonners!
GET EM!!!!

Thank goodness you're here! We've made arrangements at the inn! 
Feel free to grab some food and drink, and then get some rest!
You've got a long night ahead of you!

Hey bud, whatcha buyin'?
Glad to do business wit'cha!

I have wares... If you have coin!
I'm glad to have helped you, hero!

Man, can you believe the new mayor is siding with the monsters over us?
Yeah, just follow the money. There's no profit in just being a good person.

Ever since the mayor let the monsters run the paths going in and out of the village,
it's been getting harder to buy and sell the supplies we need!

I hear the mayor made a deal with the monsters outside the village. 
They get the woods, he gets the cash. I hope what they say about you is true!

You defeated the Mushroom Forest Village mayor's inner demons! His deals with the monsters outside the village have ceased!
You failed to defeat the Mushroom Forest Village mayor's inner demons. The townsfolk continue to suffer...

//desert canyon
Hey, it's you!
I just escaped from Desert Canyon Village up ahead!
They could really use your help! That oil monger really messed things up!
She hired a bunch of monsters to surround the village!
They have to surrender their land or who knows what will happen!

Well, look who decides to waltz on in here!
Ha, this is the legendary hero? Doesn't look so strong to me!
Hey boss, are we really sure we wanna fight this guy?
Are you kidding me? Look at all this money we're making off that oil monger!
ALRIGHT, BOYS, LET'S GET EM!

Thank goodness you're here! We'll make arrangements at the inn!
In the meantime, buy some things from us! We're glad to help you! 
And we could use the support...

Hey bud, whatcha buyin'?
Thanks bud, every bit helps!

Oh, it would be an honor to serve you!
I hope this helps you resolve our town's problems!

It's insane what people will do for oil...
It's like they completely forget how to be a good person! 
We're just trying to live peacefully.

I know that the oil here is valuable... 
But is it more valuable than human lives?

That oil monger is just the start of the problem. 
If she succeeds in usurping our land, it's going to set a terrible precedent.

I'm sick of people at the top deciding to make our lives harder for profit.
I'm glad someone like you exists! Beat the darkness out of her, bud!

You defeated the Canyon Desert Village mayor's inner demons! Her deals with the monsters have ceased!
You failed to defeat the Canyon Desert Village mayor's inner demons. The townsfolk continue to suffer...

//snowy mountain
Oh, hi there, hero!
I just came from Snowy Mountain Village! That new commissioner is really something!
He's supposed to protect us! Instead he's making deals with the monsters.
They can loot and pillage, and he turns the other way for a cut of the profits!
Come to think of it, they could use your help!

Ooooh boy!! Hi there, hero! 
Look, nothing against ya, I like the cut of your jib.
But you ain't comin' nowhere near our treasure! 
And you can forget fixing the commissioner!
GET EM!!

I wasn't expecting you! We'll make arrangements at the inn!
In the meantime, buy some things from us! Everyone would love to see you!

Well, look who it is! Been a long time!
Thanks! We should catch up over a pint!

As I live and breathe! Are you here to purchase something?
Thanks! It definitely helps an old friend!


It's really something! Even people in your home town can't resist temptation!
If that commissioner only knew you were here! HA!

Oh, I'm new here. Just moved in right before the old commissioner died.
Wait, you're that guy everyone talks about! You used to live here??

How's things been going, you rascal?
You might have everyone else fooled, but...
I remember you from the time you were 3 feet tall, and you were...
Mischevious.

Glad to see you back around these parts!
Show that new commissioner what for! We don't need outsiders ruining this town!

You defeat the Snowy Mountain Village commissioner's inner demons! His deals with the monsters have ceased!
You failed to defeat the Snowy Mountain Village commissioner's inner demons. The townsfolk continue to suffer...
