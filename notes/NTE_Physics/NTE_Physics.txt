Physics Variables

physics = holds all physics variables
	grav = holds all information regarding individual gravity
		type = integer, use directional or object-based gravity (gravType.directional or gravType.object)
		dir = real, used when doing directional gravity to determine gravity angle
		str = real, used to determine the strength of the gravity
	frict = holds all information regarding individual friction
		h = real, force of friction against this object's movements horizontally
		v = real, force of friction against this object's movements vertically
	isBouncy = boolean, whether the object should bounce (true) or not (false)

coords = holds all variables related to position
	xPrev = real, previous x value
	yPrev = real, previous y value
	xPos = real, current x position
	yPos = real, current y position
	
spd = holds all variables related to the object's speed
	h = this object's current horizontal speed
	v = this object's current vertical speed
	hPrev = this object's horizontal speed last frame
	vPrev = this object's vertical speed last frame
	mx = the maximum speed, in pixels, this object can travel in any direction on any frame

status = holds all variables regarding this object's status, not just for physics use
	isGrounded = whether the object is on the ground or not
	justLanded = whether this object just landed on the ground
	groundingBlock = the object that this object has landed on
	state = the state the object is currently in
	defaultState = the default state to put the object in if no state is set
